<h1>PASSWORD GENERATOR</h1>
<h3>STEP 1: SETTING THE RIGHT PASSWORD</h3>
<p><mark>It is important to set a password that cannot be easily cracked.Such passwords are referred to as Strong Passwords.The following are the chareacteristics of a strong password</mark><br>
For generating a secure and safe password we need to use a mixture of:<br><b>1) smallcase letters</b><br><b>2) capitalcase letters</b><br><b>3) numbers</b><br><b>4) special symbols</b><br><b>5) The password should be approximately 8 characters long</b></p>

</p>  
<h3>STEP-2: SAVING THE CREDENTIALS IN LOCAL STORAGE</h3>
<p>Once the password to be set conforms to the above conditions,the application will save the user id and password in local storage</p>
<p align="center"><img align="center" width="240" height="370" alt="2021-08-11 (5)" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82633814/128978790-d24b9ebf-f9be-4645-8c5d-b0427119b675.png"></p>
<p>Initiallly the sign-up button was active for the user to set a strong password.Now,Once the password has been successfully saved,the login button becomes active and the sign-up button is disabled.
  
 <h3>STEP-3: LOGIN</h3>
 <p>In order to be able to access your notes,you need to enter the user-id and password.If the user-id and password entered match the credentials that were set by you ,the application will take you to the notes generator.<br>
  
  
  Otherwise,if the credentials entered are incorrect,the application will drop a messsage as shown below:<br>

  </p>
  
  <h3>STEP-4: FORGOT PASSWORD </h3>
  <p>As the name speaks for itself,if you are not able to recall the password or user-id set for accessing the notes,this option will allow you to set a new password which can be used thereafter for accessing the notes.</p>

</p>


  <p>As you can observe ,the login button has now been deactivated and the sign-up button has been activated.</p>
